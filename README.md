# aquaBSD core

This repository contains the kernel & base (basic userland utilities) of aquaBSD, originally forked from (and kept very similar to) [FreeBSD](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src).
For more complete information about the general file structure, please refer to the [README file](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/blob/main/README.md) of that repository.

## Architecture support

Currently, aquaBSD core only supports the x86_64 CPU architecture (`amd64`).

## Building

It's recommended, to make things easier, to create a FreeBSD jail or chroot (technically you could also use an aquaBSD jail, but that would require a bit more setting up - in the future though, there will be special builds of aquaBSD specifically for CI) in which to install the aquaBSD core source.
You can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/T6gYmjtry50) or read [this article in the handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/) on jail creation if you don't know where to get started.
The jail you create just needs to have a C/C++ compilation toolchain ready, nothing more.

Once your jail is created, clone the sources of this repo somewhere, and create a symbolic link:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inobulles/aquabsd-core
mount -t nullfs aquabsd-core $JAIL_PATH/usr/src
ls $JAIL_PATH/usr/src/
```

(`mount -t nullfs` is equivalent to `mount --bind` on GNU/Linux.)

If you're using a chroot, you must mount `devfs`:

```sh
mount -t devfs devfs $JAIL_PATH/dev
```

Then, it's just a matter of running the build scripts in the jail:

```sh
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/clean.sh /usr/src
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/setup.sh /usr/src
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/kernel.sh /usr/src
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/base.sh /usr/src
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/distribute.sh /usr/src
chroot $JAIL_PATH sh /usr/src/ci/package.sh /usr/src
```

Building the kernel should take about 10 minutes on the first run, and then subsequent runs should only take a few seconds to a minute.

Once all that has finished, you should get two artifacts (`kernel.txz` & `base.txz`) in `aquabsd-core/artifacts`.
These artifacts can then either be directly installed, either be converted to a bootable image with [Bob the Builder](https://github.com/inobulles/aquabsd-builder).

### Note on jails with older compiler versions

aquaBSD core currently requires at minimum the LLVM 14 toolchain to compile.
If your jail's default compiler is older than this, you may install a newer version and link it to `cc` & `c++` from within the jail:

```console
ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES= pkg install llvm14
rm /usr/bin/cc /usr/bin/c++
ln -s /usr/local/bin/clang14 /usr/bin/cc
ln -s /usr/local/bin/clang++14 /usr/bin/c++
```
