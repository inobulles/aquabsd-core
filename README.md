# aquaBSD core

This repository contains the kernel & base (basic userland utilities) of aquaBSD, originally forked from (and kept very similar to) [FreeBSD](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src).
For more complete information about the general file structure, please refer to the [README file](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/blob/main/README.md) of that repository.
