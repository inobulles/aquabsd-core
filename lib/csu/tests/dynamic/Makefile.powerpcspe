# TODO: investigate and try a better fix on compiler side

# CSU tests build fails with '/usr/lib/libgcc_s.so: undefined reference to fma'
# when built with LLVM 14, so '-lm' is being added explicitly here. Only
# the powerpcspe target is affected and it may be linked to
#       https://reviews.llvm.org/D77558
